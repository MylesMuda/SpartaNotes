# Tasks

CPU Multi-core = several CPU's joined together
	One CPU :  	process information in 'threads'
	multi-core:	can ignore as a developer and let TASKS handle this for us in the background

Process : 	an exe/dll file. DLL files tend to be dormant libraries of code which get used or referenced. 
			On a computer the .exe files are the executable files which run the applications. 
			They can reference these DLL libraries, but the EXE is the one that shows up as a runnning process.

				To view: 	tasklist
				Powershell: get-process
				taskkill -PID (processID) 1234

Thread : a set of instructions sent in a batch to the CPU for processing

Application : Runs with user request afer user log-on	

Service : runs with system request after system boot : can be ok to run whether or not a user is present

C#

Threads : Detailed developer tool to have very fine control over background processes.

# Tasks

Tasks are background processes. As a developer, we hand over the runnning of the tasks to the operating system. We have NO CONTROL over which task runs when.

Common use: evening batch jobs where we go home and run various processing tasks.

	Serial ==> Order matters : Syncronous - LINE BY LINE, WAIT FOR EACH LINE
	Parallel == Order immaterial (does not matter) Asynchronous - FIRST TO FINISH, WELCOME TO FINISH WHENEVER YOU WANT
