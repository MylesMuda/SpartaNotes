# Async

If we run an application then the code will run top-down. line by line.
If an operation takes a long time, then the program will hang and appear to do nothing.

Today, we want responsive apps which don't hang unless there is a serious fault.

Examples mainly include offline/online apps which have sensitivity to the network status.
If the app goes offline, it can either stop working or revert to an offline mode.

```cs
    Main(){
        DoThisAsync(); //convention is to add "AYSNC" at the end of the method
        Console.ReadLine(); // ensure program stops and waits for async to complete. Application may otherwise terminate before the async.
    }

    async static void DoThisAsync(){ await File.ReadAsync("thisfile.txt"); //marks line where async operation takes place }

    async keyword ensures the "main" method does not wait for this method but the processing just calls the method then continues processing the next line of the main.
