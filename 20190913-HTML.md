# HTML CSS and Javascript

## Modern Web
Let's begin the day with a little 'check-the-end-to-the-beginning'

There is so much to explore in the web

HTML <hmtl><p>This is a paragraph</p></hmtl>

<tag>
	<img src = "html..." width="200" height="200"/>
</tag>

HTML : Hypertext Markup Language ==> Skeleton for the page
	Structure
		Fixed Content

<!-- BOOTSTRAP, MATERIAL DESIGN, LOOK UP ONLINE OTHER THINGS -->

# Bootstrap

Building raw from html can be very time consuming

Better to use a template and build upon it

Bootstrap provides amazing ways to get started quickly on a website

Provides all the code for free, just drop the code in

## NETLIFY
FREE WEBPAGE HOSTING

#NODEJS
JavaScript took over the web because Netscape Navigator invented it and everyone adopted it.

Today Javascript powers most, if not all of our browsers.

But, smart people from Google took JS out of the browser and made it to run on standalone as an application which we now call NODEJS.

NodeJS = JavaScript without the browser

## Build a node server

When using NodeJS we cna reference existing libraries/

To install them use:
	npm install <<library name>>

Global install (all of windows) add -g

Then use the library with
	
	var my variable = require('<<library name>>')
	var http = require('http')

## ReactJS

ReactJS builds a VIRTUAL WEBPAGE, then displays it as a REAL WEB PAGE

React can just update the bits which have changed, making dynamic pages faster.
