# Docker Setup

Docker can run 'containers' which are mini virtual machines
    virtual machine ==> 2gb max, often much less

## Goals

    1) Pull container from internet containing SQL Server
    2) Connect to it and run the SQL Server
    3) Talk to northwind server on that server

## Commands

```bash
# get image
docker pull kcornwall/sqlnorthwind
# run image
docker run -d --name sql -p 1433:1433 kcornwall/sqlnorthwind
#list running images
docker ps
# list all images
docker ps -a
#start/stop
docker start sql
docker stop sql
```

## Container to Docker Container
    
    1) Lightweight : Azure Data Studio
    2) Heavy duty : SQL server management studio

## Connection Details

    Server          localhost, 1433
    Authentication  SQL Server
    User            SA 
    Password        Passw0rd2018

## Update
```sql
update mytable set name='fred' where id=2
```

## Delete

### TAKE CARE - CAN DELETE ALL IF YOU OMMIT THE 'WHERE'

```sql
delete from mytable where id=2
```

    Aims to ensure the integrity of data within a database ie all of the relationships make sense, and all of the data is current and can be found quickly with the right searches
    No duplication of data

## 1st normal form
    One field should hold one item of data only eg mobile phone field should not hold 2 mobile numbers

    Atomic : as small as possible - one unit of data per cell

## 2nd normal form
    All keys depend on the primary key

## 3rd normal form
    no keys should have any inter-dependant relationships between eachother

    Name, Adress, Postcode, City, County.
        In theory the city and the county are related

    Name, Address, Postcode, City
    
    County
        City1
        City2
